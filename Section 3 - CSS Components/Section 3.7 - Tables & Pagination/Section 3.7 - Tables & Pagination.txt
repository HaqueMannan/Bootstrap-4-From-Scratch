Section 3.7 Tables & Pagination:

--------------------------------------
Tables & Pagination:
--------------------------------------
- To update the table UI using Bootstrap, we would simply add the class table to the <table> element. This will add the bare minimum of styling to the table:
   <table class="table"></table>

- The class table-dark will inverse the colour:
   <table class="table  table-dark"></table>

- We can give the table header the class of thead-dark which will make the table heading background of black with white text:
   <table class="table">
      <thead class="thead-dark"></thead>
   </table>

- There are many CSS style variations we can use to style tables using Bootstrap classes.

- To create a responsive table in bootstrap we would have to wrap the table in a <div> element which has the class of table-responsive. This would add a scrollbar for very small screen devices:
   <div class="table-responsive">
      <table class="table">
         ...
      </table>
   </div>

- Pagination is simply a <nav> with a <ul> and some <a> links. This acts as a naivigation to pages. Note: Bootstrap will not add the logic to move between pages, it will simply style the pagination. The <ul> will have the class of pagination while the <li> elements will have the class of page-item while the <a> element will have the class of page-link as seen below:
   <nav>
      <ul class="pagination">
         <li class="page-item">
            <a href="#" class="page-link">Previous</a>
         </li>
         <li class="page-item">
            <a href="#" class="page-link">Next</a>
         </li>
      </ul>

- To make one of the <li> elements active we would use the active class. To make a <li> disabled we would use the class disabled:
   <li class="page-item active">
   <li class="page-item disabled">

- We can align the pagination to the center or right by using the classes on the <ul> element as well as making them large and small:
   <ul class="pagination justify-content-center">
   <ul class="pagination justify-content-end">
   <ul class="pagination pagination-sm">
   <ul class="pagination pagination-lg">

- To create the left and right pointing arrows instead of using the Previous and Next text we would use two span elements to do this:
   <a class="page-link" href="#">
      <span>&laquo</span>
      <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
   </a>
   <a class="page-link" href="#">
      <span>&raquo</span>
      <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
   </a>

- We would use the character code &laquo; (left arrow) and &raquo; (right arrow) to show the arrows. The span with the class of sr-only will not display the text within the span due to the bootstrap class.


Please refer to the 3_7_tables_pagination.html markup within the bootstrap_sandbox folder for examples of the above. To view what these would look like open the html file in your browser.
