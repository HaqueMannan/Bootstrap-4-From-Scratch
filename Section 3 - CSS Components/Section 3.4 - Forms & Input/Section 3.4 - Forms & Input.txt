Section 3.4 Forms & Input:

--------------------------------------
Forms & Input:
--------------------------------------
- Within our <form> we have <label> and <input> elements that are grouped within <div>. We use the <div> element to group the form elements together which helps separate each form group - the div is given the class of form-group to help group the various form elements:
   <div class="form-group"></div>

- To make the input look much better than the default browser style we would give the class of form-control. This will make the input a block level element and the label will sit above the input box:
   <label for="name">Name</label>
   <input class="form-control" type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter Name">

- To make a input field larger or smaller we can add the following class to the <input> element:
   <input class="form-control form-control-lg" type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter Name">
   <input class="form-control form-control-sm" type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter Name">

- We can add text to the form by using form-text class and make the colour light grey by using the text-muted class:
   <small class="form-text text-muted"></small>

- The readonly attribute will make the input field a read only field i.e. you cannot enter anything within the field:
   <input class="form-control" type="password" id="password" placeholder="Password" readonly>

- The form-group and form-control classes also applies to select and text-area elements in the same way as the above.

- Inline Forms are useful for creating login forms.

- Bootstrap provides us with some classes that allows us to visually show form validation and validation messages:
   <div class="form-group">
      <input class="form-control is-valid type="text" id="username">
      <input class="form-control is-invalid type="text" id="password">
      <div class="invalid-feedback">password not strong enough</div>
   </div>
- If we do not have a is-invalid class within any of our input elements then the feedback message will not display in the browser due to the invalid-feedback class.
- This is all the UI to the validation and not the logic behind the validation. We would use JavaScript for for the form validation logic.


Please refer to the 3_4_forms.html markup within the bootstrap_sandbox folder for examples of the above. To view what these would look like open the html file in your browser.
