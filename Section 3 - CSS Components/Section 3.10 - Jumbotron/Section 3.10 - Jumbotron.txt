Section 3.10 Jumbotron:

--------------------------------------
Jumbotron:
--------------------------------------
- A Jumbotron is a kind of showcase area or a hero/header where you have a large heading with text underneath and sometimes a button or other content you want in it.
- To create a Jumbotron, you will need a <div> that wraps around the content you wish to display in the jumbotron and this <div> element requires the bootstrap class of jumbotron:
   <div class="jumbotron">
      <h1 class="display-4">Jumbotron Heading</h1>
      <p class="lead">Jumbotron text</p>
   </div>

- The rest of the content we can use the bootstrap classes that we saw in the previous sections.
- To make the jumbotron fluid we would use the class jumbotron-fluid:
   <div class="jumbotron jumbotron-fluid">
   </div>


Please refer to the 3_10_jumbotron.html markup within the bootstrap_sandbox folder for examples of the above. To view what these would look like open the html file in your browser.
