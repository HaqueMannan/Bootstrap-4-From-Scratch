Section 3.8 Working with Cards:

--------------------------------------
Working with Cards:
--------------------------------------
- Cards are a new concept in Boostrap 4.
- The simplest version of a card is a text wrapped in two <div> elements, the first with the class of card and the second with the class of card-body:
   <div class="card">
      <div class="card-body">
         Some Card Text
      </div>
   </div>

- Cards have a lot of different classes associated with them. We can use the optional classes of card-title, card-subtitle, card-header, card-footer, card-text, text-muted, text-white, card-img, card-img-top, card-image-overlay, img-fluid, bg-primary (any contextual colours), card-bodyquote, blockquote-footer:

   <div class="card bg-info text-white">
      <div class="card-header">
         My Card
      </div>
      <img class="card-img-top img-fluid" src="" alt="">
      <div class="card-body card-img-overlay">
         <h4 class="card-title">Card Title</h4>
         <p class="card-text">Some Card Text</p>
      </div>
      <div class="card-footer text-muted">
         2 Days Ago
      </div>
      <blockquote class="card-blockquote">
         <footer class="blockquote-footer">
            <small>Some Famous Quote</small>
         </footer>
      </blockquote>
   </div>

- Important Note: images must come before the card-body. 
- Cards have many different classes that can be used to allow you to make a custom card.

- The card-column class allows you to have multiple cards aligned in a column grid, this gives a great mosaic tiles of cards effect.
