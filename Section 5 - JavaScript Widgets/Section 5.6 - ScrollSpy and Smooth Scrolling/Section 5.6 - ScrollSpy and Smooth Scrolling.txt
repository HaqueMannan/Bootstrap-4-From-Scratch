Section 5.6 - ScrollSpy and Smooth Scrolling:

ScrollSpy and Smooth Scrolling:
--------------------------------------
- ScrollSpy is where you have certain sections of content on a page and you have a navigation items that pertain to the sections, ScrollSpy will make it so that when we scroll to that area/section the navigation will be highlighted for example the Welcome section will highlight the Welcome on the Navigation bar, About Section the About on the Navigation bar and so on.
- The <nav> element requires a id and each <section> element will also require an id which is linked to the <a href="#"> links of the navbar elements. This will allow the links in the navbar jump to the relevant sections. The navbar id will be used in the jQuery.
   <nav class="navbar fixed-top navbar-expand-sm navbar-light bg-light mb-3" id="main-nav">
      <div class="container">
         <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Navbar</a>
         <ul class="navbar-nav">
            <li class="nav-item">
               <a class="nav-link" href="#welcome">Welcome</a>
            </li>
         </ul>
      </div>
   </nav>
   <section id="welcome">
      ...
   </section>

- The ScrollSpy uses <script> tags and jQuery to make it work. We need the parent body element to add the scrollspy function and target the nav element with the id of main-nav or whatever you named it:
   $('body').scrollspy({ target: '#main-nav' });

- We can also go a step further and make the animation of the scrolling to the section a smooth scroll for when we click the links in the navigation bar. Again we can write some jQuery/JavaScript to do this within our <script> tags at the bottom of our markup. Breakdown of the code below:

- We want to target the element with the id of main-nav i.e. the navbar <a> link elements. On this element we want a onclick event to run a function. Essentially whenever the a link element within the navbar is clicked we want to call on a function that will run the smooth scrolling:
   $('#main-nav a').on('click', function (e) {...}

- We want to check for the hash value e.g. #welcome, #about, #services etc. using an if statement.
   if (this.hash !== '') {...}

- If the above is true then we want to prevent the default behaviour of the <a> element and we want to store the hash value in a variable.
   e.preventDefault();
   const hash = this.hash;

- Finally, we want to animate the smooth scroll. We take the html,body element and call the animate function to scroll using the hash variable above to offset the top by 900 millisecond and then use a callback function on the DOM window.location.hash to equal the hash variable:
   $('html, body').animate({
      scrollTop: $(hash).offset().top
   }, 900, function () {
      // Add hash to URL after scroll
      window.location.hash = hash;
   });

- Note we require the <script> link to the full version of the jQuery library for the smooth scroll animation as the slim version of jQuery does not have the smooth scroll.
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js" integrity="sha256-FgpCb/KJQlLNfOu91ta32o/NMZxltwRo8QtmkMRdAu8="crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
- Slim version will not work:
   <script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.slim.min.js" integrity="sha384-q8i/X+965DzO0rT7abK41JStQIAqVgRVzpbzo5smXKp4YfRvH+8abtTE1Pi6jizo"crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
